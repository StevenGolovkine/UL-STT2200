It is also an elective in actuarial science, mathematics and some engineering and business programs.\nAll students should ensure that they have taken at least one linear algebra course (e.g. MAT-1200) and one basic statistics course (e.g. STT-1000), as most data analysis methods are based on these concepts.\nStudents should also have some familiarity with basic algorithmic concepts, as well as with (at least) one programming language.",
