The various techniques we’ll be looking at can be used to:\n\nvisualize data\nreduce data size;\nidentify certain relationships between variables;\ndivide the dataset into groups/classes.\n\nThis course is not intended to be exhaustive, in the sense of presenting all possible methods. Nor is it intended to be state-of-the-art, in the sense that it will not cover the latest developments in machine learning. Nor is it a programming course.\nTo finish this introduction, here is a quote from Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath (McElreath 2020) particularly accurate in this course.\n\nStatistics courses […] tend to resemble horosscopes. There are two senses to this resemblance. First, in order to remain plausibly correct, they must remain tremendously vague. This is because the targets of the advice, for both horoscopes and statistical advice, are diverse. But only the most general advice applies to all cases. A horoscope uses only the basic facts of birth to forecast life events, and a […] statistical guide uses only the basic facts of measurement and design to dictate a model. It is easy to do better, once more detail is available. In the case of statistical analysis, it is tipically only the scientist whho can provide that detail, not the statistician. Second, there are strong incentives for both astrologers and statisticians to exaggerate the power and importance of their advice. No one likes an astrologer who forecasts doom, and few want a statistician who admits the answers as desired are not in the data as collected. Scientists desire results, and they will buy and attend to statisticians and statistical procedures that promise them. What we end up with is too often horoscopic: vague and optimistic, but still claiming critical importance.",

Let \\(M_{n}(\\mathbb{R})\\) be the set of square matrices of size \\(n\\), i.e., with \\(n\\) rows and \\(n\\) columns whose entries belong to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Let \\(M\\), \\(N\\), and \\(P\\) be matrices in \\(M_{n, m}(\\mathbb{R})\\). Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be matrices in \\(M_{n}(\\mathbb{R})\\). Let \\(I_n\\) be the identity matrix of size \\(n\\), i.e., containing \\(1\\)s on the diagonal and \\(0\\)s on the elements outside the diagonal. Let \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), i.e., column vectors of size \\(n\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of the inverse of matrices\n\n\n\nSuppose that the matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are invertible. Then the matrix product \\(AB\\) is invertible and is given by:\n\\[(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(C = AB\\) and \\(D = B^{-1} A^{-1}\\). Then\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  CD &= A B B^{-1} A^{-1} \\\\\n     &= A A^{-1} \\\\\n     &= I_n\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSimilarly, we find that \\(DC = I_n\\). Thus, \\(AB\\) is invertible and its inverse is given by \\(B^{-1} A^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of the determinant of matrices\n\n\n\nConsidering the matrices defined at the beginning of the section, we have:\n\n\\(\\text{det}(A^\\top) = \\text{det}(A)\\),\n\\(\\text{det}(AB) = \\text{det}(A)\\text{det}(B)\\),\n\\(\\text{det}(A^{-1}) = 1 / \\text{det}(A)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proofs of properties \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) are technical and are omitted, but can be found, for example, here. As for the third property, by definition, we have \\(A A^{-1} = I_n\\). The determinant of \\(I_n\\) is equal to \\(1\\) (product of the elements on the diagonal). Therefore, \\(\\text{det}(A A^{-1}) = 1\\). However, according to the second property, \\(\\text{det}(A A^{-1}) = \\text{det}(A)\\text{det}(A^{-1})\\). We therefore have \\(\\text{det}(A^{-1}) = 1 / \\text{det}(A)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of the trace of matrices\n\n\n\nConsidering the matrices defined at the beginning of the section, we have:\n\n\\(\\text{tr}(A) = \\text{tr}(A^{\\top})\\),\n\\(\\text{tr}(A + B) = \\text{tr}(A) + \\text{tr}(B)\\),\n\\(\\text{tr}(MN^{\\top}) = \\text{tr}(N^{\\top}M)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a square matrix \\(A\\), let \\(a_{ij}\\) be the element of matrix \\(A\\) in row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\). The trace of \\(A\\) is given by the sum of the diagonal elements, i.e. \\(\\text{tr}(A) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ii}\\).\n\nSince transposition does not change the diagonal elements, the result is straightforward.\nLet \\(C = A + B\\). Since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are square matrices, \\(C\\) is a square matrix. We have \\(c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}\\) for all \\(i, j = 1, \\dots, n\\). Therefore \\[\\text{tr}(A + B) = \\text{tr}(C) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{ii} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ii} + b_{ii} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ii} + \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} b_{ii} = \\text{tr}(A) + \\text{tr}(B).\\]\nThe matrices \\(M N^{\\top}\\) and \\(N^{\\top} M\\) are square, with dimensions \\(n \\times n\\) and \\(m \\times m\\) respectively, so we can calculate their traces. Let \\(C = M N^{\\top}\\) and \\(D = N^{\\top} M\\). \\[\\text{tr}(M N^{\\top}) = \\text{tr}(C) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{ii} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\sum_{j = 1}^{m} m_{ij} n_{ji} = \\sum_{j = 1}^{m} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} n_{ji} m_{ij} = \\sum_{j = 1}^{m} d_{jj} = \\text{tr}(D)  = \\text{tr}(N^{\\top} M).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(A\\) be a symmetric matrix in \\(M_n(\\mathbb{R})\\). \\(A\\) is positive definite if \\(u^\\top A u &gt; 0\\) for all \\(u \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(u \\neq 0\\).\nLet \\(A \\in M_n(\\mathbb{R})\\). \\(A\\) is orthogonal if \\(A^\\top A = A A^\\top = I_n\\).",

We have \\(A u_{1} = \\lambda_{1} u_{1}\\) and \\(A u_{2} = \\lambda_{2} u_{2}\\). Then \\[\\lambda_{1} u_{1}^{\\top} u_{2} = u_{1}^\\top A u_{2} = \\lambda_{2} u_{1}^\\top u_{2}.\\] This implies that \\((\\lambda_{1} - \\lambda_{2})u_{1}^\\top u_{2} = 0\\). However, \\(\\lambda_{1} \\neq \\lambda_{2}\\). Therefore, necessarily, \\(u_{1}^\\top u_{2} = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nThis second property will be useful when we look at dimension reduction and, in particular, principal component analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacterization of matrices with their eigenvalues\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(A\\) is symmetric, then all its eigenvalues are real.\nIf \\(A\\) is positive definite, then all its eigenvalues are strictly positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the more general case where \\(A\\) is a Hermitian matrix. The matrix \\(A\\) is equal to the transpose of its conjugate, denoted \\(A^*\\). Let \\(\\lambda\\) be an eigenvalue associated with an eigenvector \\(u\\), which may be complex. We have: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\overline{u}^{\\top} A u &= \\overline{u}^\\top \\lambda u = \\lambda \\overline{u}^{\\top} u, \\\\\n\\overline{u}^\\top A u &= \\overline{u}^\\top A^* u = \\overline{Au}^\\top u = \\overline{\\lambda} \\overline{u}^\\top u.\n\\end{align}\\] This implies that \\((\\lambda - \\overline{\\lambda}) \\overline{u}^{\\top} u = 0\\). Since \\(u \\neq 0\\), we have \\(\\lambda = \\overline{\\lambda}\\). Therefore, \\(\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\nConsider \\(u\\), an eigenvector of \\(A\\) associated with the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\). We have that \\(u^{\\top} A u = \\lambda u^{\\top} u\\). However, since \\(u \\neq 0\\), \\(u^{\\top}u \\neq 0\\). Therefore, \\[\\lambda = \\frac{u^{\\top} A u}{u^{\\top} u}.\\] Since \\(A\\) is positive definite, \\(u^{\\top} A u &gt; 0\\) for all nonzero vectors \\(u\\).
