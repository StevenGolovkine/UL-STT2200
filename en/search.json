    "text": "Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) can be presented as an extension of PCA. It allows for the graphical representation of frequency tables containing more than two variables. A classic example of a frequency table with more than two qualitative variables is a table presenting individuals’ responses to a questionnaire containing \\(Q\\) multiple-choice questions. MCA is therefore very useful for visualizing the results of a questionnaire-based study.\nMCA can also be seen as a version of PCA when the variables are mixed, i.e., comprising both quantitative and qualitative variables. The joint processing of these two types of data is based on their prior transformation called complete disjunctive coding.",

    "text": "Notation\nLet \\(n\\) be the number of individuals (or observations) and \\(Q\\) the number of variables (or questions in the case of a questionnaire). Each variable has \\(J_q\\) modalities and the total number of modalities is equal to \\(J\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningDefinition\n\n\n\nThe binary table, i.e., containing only \\(0\\)s and \\(1\\)s, with \\(n\\) rows and \\(J\\) columns is called a complete disjointive coding table. We denote it by \\(Z\\).\n\n\nThus, a variable is not treated as such but through its modalities. It is divided into modalities, and each individual is then coded \\(1\\) for the modality they possess and \\(0\\) for the others (i.e., those they do not possess, as the modalities are exclusive). This coding is immediate for qualitative variables. However, for a qualitative variable, we first divide the variable into classes. Thus, each individual belongs to only one class. This process of transforming information is called complete disjunctive coding. It is indeed coding, because the initial information is transformed; disjunctive, because each individual has at most one modality; and complete, because each individual has at least one modality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nLet’s take, for example, a set of products with different types (Hoodie, Joggers, and Sneakers) and different prices. We have \\(7\\) observations (\\(7\\) products). The variable Type is a qualitative variable and the variable Price is a quantitative variable.\n\nProduct dataset.\n\n\nProduct\nType\nPrice ($)\n\n\n\n\nNike Tech Fleece\nHoodie\n256.72\n\n\nPuma Joggers\nJoggers\n221.26\n\n\nOff-White Hoodie\nHoodie\n198.45\n\n\nSupreme Hoodie\nHoodie\n235.50\n\n\nJordan 1 High\nSneakers\n298.22\n\n\nNike Dunk Low\nSneakers\n273.00\n\n\nNike Tech Fleece\nHoodie\n162.38\n\n\n\nTo encode the information in a complete disjunctive coding table, we define three price classes (price below $200, price between $200 and $250, and price above $250). This allows us to encode the variable Price using the above classes. The complete disjunctive table is given in the following table.\nProduct | Hoodie | Joggers | Sneakers | $&lt;$200 | between $200 and $250 | $&gt;$250 |\n|——–:|:—– -:|:——-:|:——–:|:——:|:-:|:-:| |Nike Tech Fleece |1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | |Puma Joggers |0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | |Off-White Hoodie |1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | |Supreme Hoodie |1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | |Jordan 1 High |0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | |Nike Dunk Low |0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | |Nike Tech Fleece |1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n: Product dataset in complete disjunctive coding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipNote\n\n\n\nWhen transforming quantitative variables into a complete disjunctive coding table, information is lost. This is because qualitative variables must be divided into classes, and class membership is less informative than a specific variable value. In the previous example, information about price is lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantProperties\n\n\n\n\nThe sum of the elements in the same row is constant and equals \\(Q\\).\nThe sum of all the elements in the table equals \\(nQ\\).\nThe sum of the elements in the same column equals the count \\(n_j\\) with modality \\(j\\) of variable \\(q\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteProof\n\n\n\n\n\nSince \\(Z\\) is a complete disjunctive array, we have \\[\\sum_{j = 1}^{J_q} z_{ij} = 1.\\] Therefore, we find that \\[z_{i \\bullet} = \\sum_{j = 1}^{J} z_{ij} = \\sum_{q = 1}^{Q} \\sum_{j = 1}^{J_q} z_{ij} = Q, \\]\n\\[z_{\\bullet j} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} z_{ij} = n_j,\\]\n\\[z_{\\bullet \\bullet} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\sum_{j = 1}^{J} z_{ij} = nQ.\\]",

For continuous variables, the boundaries should be relevant to the problem being studied. For example, we would not define a class \\(&gt; 1000\\) in the previous example. To obtain relevant bounds, we can look at the distributions of the variables, e.g., with a histogram. In some specific cases, it is possible to divide the variable into equal-sized categories. However, this approach can lead to irrelevant categories.\nIn the case of qualitative variables, the choice of classes does not arise; it is given by the variable. However, “natural” modalities can lead to (very) unbalanced frequencies. In this case, we generally need to proceed with groupings. Here again, a good knowledge of the field being studied is necessary. In any case, it is preferable to group modalities rather than randomly distribute modalities with low frequencies among the other modalities (which is sometimes proposed in software).",

This method is used when there are \\(n\\) observations of \\(p\\) continuous numerical variables with \\(p\\) too “large” to allow for effective modeling or visualization.

The idea is simple: we want to combine \\(p\\) variables into a single one, but while “capturing” as much of the variability as possible.\nFirst, we must add a constraint on \\(\\alpha_{1}\\), since otherwise we would only have to take \\(\\alpha_{1k} = \\pm \\infty\\) and we would have \\(\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{1}) = +\\infty\\), which is definitely maximal!

Since \\[\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{2}) = \\alpha_{2}^\\top \\Sigma \\alpha_{2} = \\alpha_{2}^\\top \\lambda \\alpha_{2} = \\lambda,\\] we have that this variance is maximal if \\(\\lambda = \\lambda_{2}\\), the second largest eigenvalue of \\(\\Sigma\\), and consequently \\(\\alpha_{2}\\) is the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\nWe can generalize this result using successive maximizations. We conclude that \\[Y_k = \\alpha_k^\\top X,\\] where \\(\\alpha_k\\) is the normalized eigenvector associated with \\(\\lambda_k\\), the \\(k\\)th largest eigenvalue of \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\n\n\nIt is possible to have a more compact representation of PCA using matrices.

    "text": "Practice of PCA\n\nEstimation of the variance-covariance matrix\nIn practice, the variance-covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) is unknown. To perform PCA, it is necessary to estimate \\(\\Sigma\\) from a random sample \\(X_{1}, \\dots, X_n\\) of independent realizations of \\(X\\). An (unbiased) estimator of \\(\\Sigma\\) is given by \\[\\widehat{\\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\left( X_i - \\overline{X} \\right)\\left( X_i - \\widehat{X} \\right)^{\\top},\\] where \\(\\overline{X}\\) is the empirical mean of the sample.\nThe matrix \\(\\widehat{\\Sigma}\\) thus obtained is symmetric with real coefficients and therefore diagonalizable. It admits a spectral decomposition of the form \\[\\widehat{\\Sigma} = \\widehat{A} \\widehat{\\Lambda} \\widehat{A}^{\\top},\\] where \\(\\widehat{A}\\) is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the estimators of the eigenvectors of \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\Lambda}\\) is a diagonal matrix containing the estimators of the eigenvalues of \\(\\Sigma\\), assumed to be ordered in descending order.\nThe principal components are obtained by projecting the observations \\(X_i\\) onto the basis of eigenvectors: \\[Y_i = \\widehat{A}^{\\top} X_i.\\]\n\n\nSome remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSensitivity to the scale of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\)\n\n\n\nSince we are looking for a linear combination of \\(X_{1}, \\dots, X_p\\) that maximizes the variance, a variable \\(X_k\\) with a large variance will have a disproportionate weight in the principal components, which can distort the interpretation. One example is distance measurement. Expressing distance in meters rather than kilometers would multiply the variance of this variable by \\(1\\) million \\((10^3)^2\\). This variable would therefore have a major weight in all components.\nThus, if the variables are expressed in different units or have very different orders of magnitude, it is recommended to standardize the variables before performing PCA. This is equivalent to performing PCA on the correlation matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFirst step in predictive analysis\n\n\n\nSometimes PCA is performed because we want to predict the value of variable \\(Z\\) from the values of variables \\(X_{1}, \\dots, X_p\\), but \\(p\\) is simply too large. In this case, PCA is applied to obtain the first \\(k \\ll p\\) principal components \\(Y_1, \\dots, Y_k\\) and these are used to predict \\(Z\\).\nSince the principal components retain most of the information contained in the original variables, this is generally a reasonable approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAxis rotation and representation quality\n\n\n\nSince the matrix \\(A\\) is orthogonal, the matrix product \\(Y = A^{\\top}X\\) represents a rotation of the variable space. The new axes correspond to the successive orthogonal directions of maximum variation, assuming that \\(\\lambda_{1} &gt; \\dots &gt; \\lambda_p\\). Thus, \\(Y_i = A^{\\top} X_i\\) gives the coordinates of the observation \\(X_i\\) in the new axis system. We call \\(Y_{ik}\\) the score of the observation \\(X_i\\) on the principal axis \\(k\\) and calculate it as \\[Y_{ik} = \\alpha_k^\\top X_i = \\sum_{l = 1}^{p} \\alpha_{kl}X_{il}.\\]\nThe quality of the representation of observation \\(i\\) on axis \\(k\\) is given by \\[Q_{ik} = \\frac{Y_{ik}^2}{d^2(0, Y_i)} = \\frac{Y_{ik}^2}{\\sqrt{Y_{i1}^2 + \\dots + Y_{i p}^2}}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the number of components\nA key issue in PCA is choosing how many principal components to retain. Retaining too many does not reduce the dimension, and retaining too few can result in the loss of relevant information. Here are the main rules of thumb used:\n\n80% rule: Retain the minimum number of components necessary to explain at least 80% of the total variance. This threshold is arbitrary, but it often provides a good intuition.\nKaiser’s rule: If PCA is performed using the correlation matrix, then the average eigenvalue is 1. It is recommended to keep only those components with an eigenvalue greater than the average eigenvalue, i.e., \\(1\\).\nJoliffe’s rule: A stricter variant of Kaiser’s rule, which suggests keeping components with an eigenvalue greater than \\(0.7\\) for PCA performed using the correlation matrix.\nCattell’s rule (or elbow rule): Plot the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_k\\) as a function of their rank \\(k\\) and look for a breakpoint in the decline. Beyond this point, additional components explain little additional variance.\n\nThese rules are decision-making tools, but the choice of the number of components also depends on the context, the objectives of the analysis, and ease of interpretation.",

    "text": "Associated spaces\nOnce our data has been collected, the first step in statistical analysis is to choose a mathematical space in which to work. This space, sometimes called the observation space and denoted by \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), depends on the type of data observed. It constitutes the formal framework in which our variables take their values, and it guides the methodological choices that follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCase of a numerical variable\n\n\n\nWhen observing a numerical variable (e.g., the temperature of a country), the natural space in which to work is the set of real numbers, \\(\\mathcal{X} = \\mathbb{R}\\). In some cases, this space can be restricted to a specific interval. For example, if we are interested in a person’s height, we can take \\(\\mathcal{X} = [0, +\\infty)\\) because the variable in question cannot be negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCase of a nominal (or qualitative, or categorical) variable\n\n\n\nFor a nominal variable, the space is a finite set of modalities, the set of modalities taken by the variable. For example, if we study the results of a dice roll, the variable can take values from \\(1\\) to \\(6\\), and the associated space will therefore be \\(\\mathcal{X} = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}\\).\n\n\nWhen the data is more complex, more suitable spaces must be chosen. For curve or signal analysis, we can work in a function space. For example, we can consider the space of continuous functions on a closed interval \\([a, b]\\), denoted \\(\\mathcal{X} = \\mathcal{C}([a, b])\\). For text analysis (viewed as a sequence of characters), the workspace can be an alphabet. For example, we can consider \\(\\mathcal{X} = \\{ \\text{A}, \\text{B}, \\dots, \\text{Z} \\}\\).\nOften, several variables are observed at the same time, e.g., the height, weight, and gender of an individual. In this case, the observation space will be the Cartesian product (also called the product set) of the spaces associated with each variable: \\[\\mathcal{X} = \\mathcal{X}_1 \\times \\mathcal{X}_2 \\times \\dots \\mathcal{X}_p,\\] where \\(p\\) is the number of variables. In the case where we observe \\(p\\) numerical variables, we will simply write \\(\\mathcal{X} = \\mathbb{R}^p\\).",

Once the objectives have been defined, preliminary processing and basic exploration of the data is carried out, followed by more developed models.\n\nWhere can data be found?\nThe simple answer is: on the Internet! Here is a non-exhaustive list of websites that collect data sets:\n\nGoogle datasets;\nKaggle;\nUC Irvine Machine Learning Repository;\nTime Series Machine Learning website;\nPhysionet Database.\n\nYou can also check out the official websites of data sources that can be found for most countries around the world:\n\nCanada: StatCan;\nFrance: data.gouv.fr;\nUSA: data.gov;\nEngland: data.gouv.uk;\netc.\n\nFor data on more specific topics, you can look at the different branches of government. For example, the Canadian Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation provides geospatial data for Canada (here).\nWhen working for a company, you generally have access to internal data sources, e.g. databases on production, customers and employees, lists of transactions and potential customers, information on website visits.\n\n\nQuality\nThere is a popular saying in computer science that also applies to data analysis: “Garbage in, garbage out.” Basically, this means that no matter how sophisticated the model is, if the input data is poor quality, biased, incomplete, etc., then the output results will be poor quality. This ensures a certain level of credibility, reproducibility, and usability for our conclusions.\nBut what do we mean by data quality? To ensure data quality, we can ask ourselves the following questions:\n\nIs the data representative of the target population?\nIs the data correct and relevant?\nIs there any missing or redundant data?\n\n\n\nBuilding the database\nOnce our data has been retrieved, we need to load it into memory so that we can then perform analyses. In Python, the pandas library can read most of the file formats we will be dealing with. In R, different libraries need to be used to load different types of data (see Table 2).\n\n\n\nTable 2: Different libraries for different file formats.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\nExtension\nLibrary\n\n\n\n\nText\n.txt; .csv\nreadr\n\n\nExcel\n.xlsx\nreadxl\n\n\nSAS\n.sas7bdat\nhaven\n\n\nSPSS\n.sav; .zsav\nhaven\n\n\nJSON\n.json\njsonlite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, the concept of “tidy data” has emerged (see Wickham (2014)). Each “tidy” dataset follows three principles:\n\nEach variable is a column in the table.\nEach observation is a row in the table.\nEach cell in the table corresponds to a single measurement.\n\nThis allows for a unified approach to data analysis. In general, we will always try to put our dataset in “tidy” format. The tidyr package in R and the pandas library in Python allow you to format data in “tidy” format.\n\n\nExploration and preliminary processing\nOnce the data has been loaded and formatted in “tidy” format, we perform an initial exploration of the data before moving on to the model development stage itself. Although this stage is very important, it is not the focus of this course. Here are a few tips for this initial exploration:\n\nData cleaning: remove duplicates, standardize modalities, check the format of special values, etc.\nData exploration: rare modalities, too many modalities, asymmetry, class imbalance, extreme or outlier values, highly correlated variables, missing values.",

The various techniques we’ll be looking at can be used to:\n\nvisualize data\nreduce data size;\nidentify certain relationships between variables;\ndivide the dataset into groups/classes.\n\nThis course is not intended to be exhaustive, in the sense of presenting all possible methods. Nor is it intended to be state-of-the-art, in the sense that it will not cover the latest developments in machine learning. Nor is it a programming course.\nTo finish this introduction, here is a quote from Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath (McElreath 2020) particularly accurate in this course.\n\nStatistics courses […] tend to resemble horoscopes. There are two senses to this resemblance. First, in order to remain plausibly correct, they must remain tremendously vague. This is because the targets of the advice, for both horoscopes and statistical advices, are diverse. But only the most general advice applies to all cases. A horoscope uses only the basic facts of birth to forecast life events, and a […] statistical guide uses only the basic facts of measurement and design to dictate a model. It is easy to do better, once more detail is available. In the case of statistical analysis, it is typically only the scientist who can provide that detail, not the statistician. Second, there are strong incentives for both astrologers and statisticians to exaggerate the power and importance of their advice. No one likes an astrologer who forecasts doom, and few want a statistician who admits the answers as desired are not in the data as collected. Scientists desire results, and they will buy and attend to statisticians and statistical procedures that promise them. What we end up with is too often horoscopic: vague and optimistic, but still claiming critical importance.\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning (xkcd:1838).",

    "text": "This page is inspired by this document.\nLike R, Python is “just” a programming language, so it is possible to write Python code in a text editor and run it via a terminal. Although this is feasible, it is easier to use a code editor. While it is technically possible to use RStudio as an editor for Python, I would recommend using a specialized editor such as PyCharm. The notebook format is also very popular in Python. In this case, I would recommend the marimo library, which allows you to convert your .py files into notebooks.\nIn addition, it is best to make sure you are working with the latest stable version of Python that is compatible with the packages you are using (e.g., numpy, matplotlib, sklearn). Very often, there is a delay before the latest versions of packages are compatible with the latest version of Python. It is therefore important to share the version of the packages used with the analysis.\nRegarding documentation, the standard in Python is to follow the recommendations of PEP 257. The Sphinx library allows you to generate documentation from docstrings.\nA uniform syntax makes code much easier to read and understand. A style guide sets out standards for uniform syntax. The PEP 8 style guide is recommended in Python.\nLine breaks and indentation\nIndentation is part of Python, i.e. if...else and for blocks are defined using indentation. You can use either tabs or spaces. The choice is yours, but it is important to be consistent in your code.\nNaming convention\nThe use of single-character variable names should be avoided. Otherwise, variables, functions, methods, packages, and modules are named with lowercase letters, numbers, and the underscore _. Classes and exceptions should be named with uppercase letters to separate words (UneClasse). Constants are in uppercase.\nCode organization\nAs with R, when the code starts to get long, it is advantageous to split it into several files. For example, you can have one file per part of the analysis (one for data cleaning, one for analysis, one for visualization, etc.). You can also create several subfolders.\nSome things to do\n\nDo not make comparisons to True, False, or None.\n\n\nif attr:\n    print(\"True!\")\n\nif not attr:\n    print(\"False!\")\n\nif attr is None:\n    print(\"None!\")\n\n\nUse list comprehension when possible.\n\n\na = [3, 4, 5]\nb = [i for i in a if i &gt; 4]\n\n\nLoad a file with with. This ensures that the connection to the file is closed once it has been read.\n\n\nwith open(\"file.txt\") as f:\n    read(f)\n\n\nUse a maximum of 80 characters per line.\nUse parentheses to wrap long strings."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This page is based on a document created by Aurélien Nicosia (ULaval) in 2023 called “Bonnes pratiques de programmation en R.” It has been updated.\nSince R is “just” a programming language, it is technically possible to use a simple text editor to write R code and a terminal to run it. However, it is much more convenient—especially for beginners—to use a code editor such as RStudio to run your code. This allows you to run your code interactively, view your working environment, test your code, and more.\nIn addition, it is best to make sure you are working with the latest version of R and the packages you need. This reduces the risk of encountering bugs and allows you to take advantage of the latest features. One point to note, however, is that I would advise against changing the version of R or the packages once you have started working on something. This change could introduce bugs in the middle of the analysis (so always report the versions of the packages used for reproducibility). You can get a summary of the working environment with the systemInfo() and packageVersion(pkg) functions.\nRegarding documentation, the roxygen package allows you to convert comments in your functions and packages into clean documentation.\nA uniform syntax makes code much easier to read and understand. A style guide sets standards for uniform syntax. The tidyverse style guide (https://style.tidyverse.org) is recommended in R. Before presenting some style conventions, note that you can quickly change the formatting of a piece of R code in RStudio in the “Code -&gt; Reformat Selection” menu.\nLine breaks and indentation\nA simple way to make your code more readable is to insert appropriate line breaks and indentations. For example, suppose we have the following character string:\n\ntext &lt;- \"Ceci est un example\"\n\nWe want to correct two errors in this sentence: the word “example” written in English rather than French and the missing period at the end of the sentence. This can be done with the following instruction:\n\npaste0(gsub(pattern = \"example\", replacement = \"example\", x = text), \".\")\n\nThis instruction contains one function call nested within another. It is much easier to read as follows:\n\npaste0(\n  gsub(\n    pattern = \"example\",\n    replacement = \"exemple\",\n    x = text),\n  \".\")\n\nAssignment operator\nIn R, &lt;- is used to assign a value to a variable, and = is used to pass values to arguments in a function call.\nNaming conventions\nThe tydiverse style guide recommends using lowercase letters, numbers, and the underscore _ to name variables and functions. Underscores are used to separate words in a name. Although other conventions may be found, these should be avoided. In any case, it is important to choose a convention and stick to it. In addition, it is best to avoid accents in variable names.\nCode organization\nWhen the code starts to get long, it becomes advantageous to separate it into several files. For example, you can have one file per part of the analysis (one for data cleaning, one for analysis, one for visualization, etc.). In addition, a data analysis does not usually consist solely of R code, e.g., C++ code files, data files, configuration files, etc. It is therefore recommended to create subfolders grouping files of the same type. RStudio projects are ideal for gathering all project-related files in one place. In addition, they make it easier to work on several projects simultaneously by managing the transition from one working directory to another.\nA few things to do\n\nWrite your code in a script and save it frequently. This prevents you from losing track of important instructions because they were written directly in the console.\nIt is best to start every R work session with an empty work environment. To do this, disable automatic session image restoration in the settings. This allows you to be aware of the presence of different objects in the working environment.\nDo not use the load function when the working environment is not empty. This prevents you from modifying an object in the working environment by overwriting it.\nDo not use the attach function. This prevents you from modifying the file search path.\nSave the graphics options and settings before modifying them.\nDo not use T and F instead of TRUE and FALSE."

Therefore, \\(\\text{det}(A A^{-1}) = 1\\). However, according to the second property, \\(\\text{det}(A A^{-1}) = \\text{det}(A)\\text{det}(A^{-1})\\).

    "text": "Random vectors\nSuppose that \\(X = (X_{1}, X_{2})\\) is a random variable of dimension \\(2\\) with density \\(f_{X}\\). Random variables of dimension greater than \\(1\\) are generally referred to as random vectors. The densities of \\(X_{1}\\) and \\(X_{2}\\) are called marginal densities. When \\(X_{1}\\) and \\(X_{2}\\) are independent, we have: \\[f_X(x, y) = f_{X_{1}}(x) \\cdot f_{X_{2}}(y), \\quad (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample of the multivariate normal distribution\n\n\n\nA random vector \\(X\\) of dimension \\(p\\) is said to follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\Sigma\\) if its density is given by \\[f_X(x) = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{p /2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(\\text{det} \\Sigma)^{1/2}} \\cdot \\exp\\left\\{ -\\frac{1}{2}\\left( x - \\mu \\right)^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} \\left( x - \\mu \\right) \\right\\}, \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^p.\\]\nWe denote \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}_{p}(\\mu, \\Sigma)\\).\n\n\nIn statistics, an important quantity to measure is the linear dependence between \\(X_{1}\\) and \\(X_{2}\\).

If they are strictly positive, \\(X_{1}\\) and \\(X_{2}\\) tend to move in the same direction. If \\(X_{1}\\) increases, then \\(X_{2}\\) also increases, and vice versa. If they are strictly negative, \\(X_{1}\\) and \\(X_{2}\\) tend to move in opposite directions. If \\(X_{1}\\) increases, then \\(X_{2}\\) decreases, and vice versa.

    "title": "Pipe operator in R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This page is based on a document created by Aurélien Nicosia (ULaval) in 2023 called “Pipe Operator.” It has been updated.\nSince version 4.1.0 of R, released in May 2021, the language has introduced the pipe operator |&gt;, inspired by what the magrittr package was doing. Starting with R 4.3.0, the style guide for the tidyverse recommends using the basic pipe operator, not the one from magrittr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKeyboard shortcuts\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, the keyboard shortcut for inserting the pipe operator is:\n\nOn Windows: Ctrl + Shift + M\nOn macOS: ⌘ + ⇧ + M\n\n\n\nThis operator introduces a way to chain instructions and pass arguments to functions in a more readable way than the traditional method.\nTo summarize how this operator works, here is how it transforms a few function calls:\n\nf(x) becomes x |&gt; f();\nf(x, y) becomes x |&gt; f(y);\nh(g(f(x))) becomes x |&gt; f() |&gt; g() |&gt; h().\n\nThis operator allows you to highlight the sequence of actions rather than the object on which the sequence of actions is performed. This makes the code more readable (and having readable code is a good practice). Reading the instruction h(g(f(x))) from left to right, we first see the call to the function h, then the call to the function g, and finally the call to the function f. However, this instruction is evaluated in reverse order. In fact, R will first:\n\nevaluate f(x);\nthen pass the result to the function g and return the result;\nwhich will be passed to the function h and the final result will be returned.\n\nIf we want to write code that correctly reflects the order of evaluation, we could write:\n\nres1 &lt;- f(x)\nres2 &lt;- g(res1)\nh(res2)\n\nHowever, this code has the disadvantage of creating objects that we do not necessarily want to keep. The |&gt; operator does not have this disadvantage! In fact, an instruction written using the |&gt; operator allows us to follow the order of evaluations without creating unnecessary objects in memory.\nFor even greater clarity, it is possible to extend an instruction containing several |&gt; operators over several lines so that there is one function per line:\n\nx |&gt; \n  f() |&gt; \n  g() |&gt; \n  h()\n\nIf the argument we want to pass with the |&gt; operator is not the first one, we must use _ as follows with a named argument: f(y, z = x) becomes x |&gt; f(y, z = _).\nLet’s take an example to illustrate the use of the |&gt; operator. Suppose we have the following character string:\n\ntext &lt;- \"This is an example\"\n\nand we want to correct it—replace “example” with “example” and add a period at the end—with the following instruction:\n\npaste0(gsub(pattern = \"example\", replacement = \"example\", x = text), \".\")\n\n[1] \"This is an example.\"\n\n\nThis instruction is a little difficult to read because of the call to the gsub function nested within a call to the paste0 function. We could rewrite it as follows using the |&gt; operator:\n\ntext |&gt; \n  gsub(pattern = \"example\", replacement = \"example\", x = _) |&gt; \n  paste0(\".\")\n\n[1] \"This is an example.\"\n\n\nLet’s take another numerical example. We want to perform the following calculation: \\[\\frac{(2 + 4) \\times 8}{2}.\\]\nTo do this, we need a few mathematical functions.\n\nadd &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  x + y\n}\n\nmul &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  x * y\n}\n\ndiv &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  x / y\n}\n\nWe can perform the calculation in three different ways:\n\n# By creating different objects \nres1 &lt;- add(2, 4)\nres2 &lt;- mul(res1, 8)\nres3 &lt;- div(res2, 2)\nprint(res3)\n\n[1] 24\n\n# By nesting functions\nres &lt;- div(mul(add(2, 4), 8), 2)\nprint(res)\n\n[1] 24\n\n# With the pipe operator \nres &lt;- 2 |&gt;\n  add(4) |&gt; \n  mul(8) |&gt; \n  div(2)\nprint(res)\n\n[1] 24"

This raises the question of what constitutes “good” code. For me, “good” code is code that fulfills three objectives:\nWhy is it desirable to adopt good practices?

Therefore, “good” code must produce the right results. To achieve this, the code must first be functional, i.e., it must not contain any bugs. To ensure that the code works correctly, it simply needs to be tested. It is better to test frequently, with each small addition, rather than producing a lot of code before testing it. This way, there is much less debugging to do. One school of thought in computer science even advocates writing tests before writing code (test-driven development). However, a better practice is to formalize the tests so that they can be easily rerun when future changes are made to the code."

    "text": "Objective 2: Easy-to-maintain code\nMaintaining computer code means ensuring that it continues to function properly in the future, despite any changes made to it. Code that is used frequently is code that will need to be updated, either to add features or to fix bugs that were not detected by testing but discovered by users. Taking over code written by someone else, or written by ourselves a few months ago, is not always an easy task. However, if the code is written correctly, it should not be too difficult to understand and modify.\nCode maintenance is based on three principles: versioning, comprehensibility, and reusability.\nThe principle of versioning is to use software that records the various changes made to the code. The best known is Git. It allows you to navigate between different versions of your code, create multiple versions (called branches), and collaborate with others on the same code. It is truly an essential tool to have in your arsenal. Versioning can then be recorded on Github, which manages the underlying machinery. For example, this site uses Git and Github for versioning, and you can see the different versions here.\nComprehensible code is clear and easy to read (almost like text). It often includes instructions that are self-explanatory. These instructions are typically succinct, as overly long instructions often perform several tasks that are difficult to discern. If reading an instruction does not allow a programmer familiar with the computer language used to understand what it does, it is recommended to insert a comment in the code to explain what the instruction is for. In addition to comments explaining certain instructions, all functions should be documented. The documentation for a function should contain: an explanatory text describing what the function does, a description of the arguments accepted as input, a description of the results produced, and an example of use. When programming, it is also good practice to follow a style guide. A style guide is a set of rules that developers have agreed upon to ensure consistent syntax across different projects. In R, you can use the tidyverse style guide. In Python, you can use the PEP8 style guide written by the creator of Python. And in Julia, you can use the style guide provided with the language manual. You can use a linter, a static code analysis tool, to help you comply with these style guides. Note that these style guides are recommendations and there is no obligation to follow them. Some rules contradict each other, so I would even recommend not following some of them.\nThe most common way to make code easy to reuse is to turn it into functions that can then be shared through a package."

Although this is not the most important criterion for defining “good” code, it is still a criterion that should not be overlooked, as code that is too slow may not be used. To produce computationally efficient code, you need to:\n\nput a few simple tricks into practice, i.e., use the optimized syntaxes of the different languages;\ncompare the execution time of different ways of programming a task;\nsometimes perform parallel calculations;\nsometimes program pieces of code in another, lower-level language."

For the purposes of this course, we will make the following assumptions: the random variable \\(\\varepsilon\\) is independent of the explanatory variables \\(X\\), \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon] = 0\\), and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon) = \\sigma^2\\). The Equation 1 is general. It serves as a framework for all the methods we will study, even when the explicit form of \\(f\\) is not known.\nThe Figure 1 illustrates the different elements of the model: the observed data \\((X_i, Y_i)\\), the function \\(f\\) (in blue), and the random deviations \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) represented by dotted lines.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ngenerate_noisy_data &lt;- function(n = 100, noise_levels = c(0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5)) { \n# x values ​​(avoid 0 for log) \nx_vals &lt;- seq(0.01, 0.99, length.out = n) \n\n# True function \nf &lt;- function(x) 4 * x * (1 - x) * log(x) + 2 \n\n# Generate data for each noise level \ndata &lt;- lapply(noise_levels, function(sigma) { \ny_true &lt;- f(x_vals) \ny_noisy &lt;- y_true + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(sigma)) \n\ntibble( \nx = x_vals, \ny = y_noisy, \nnoise = sigma \n) \n}) %&gt;% bind_rows() \n\nreturn(data)\n}\n\n# Example usage\nset.seed(123)\n\nnoise_levels &lt;- seq(0, 0.5, by=0.01)\ndf &lt;- generate_noisy_data(noise_levels = noise_levels)\nwrite.csv(df, './data.csv')\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata = FileAttachment(\"../../include/data/bias-variance/data.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n\nviewof noise = Inputs.range( \n[0.01, 0.5], \n{value: 0.25, step: 0.01, label: tex`\\sigma^2`}\n)\n\nfiltered = data.filter(function(df) { \nreturn df.noise == noise;\n})\n\ntrue_curve = data.filter(function(df) { \nreturn df.noise == 0;\n})\n\nerrors = filtered.map(f =&gt; { \nconst location = true_curve.find(loc =&gt; loc.x === f.x); \nreturn { ...f, y_end: location?.y };\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nPlot.plot({ \ngrid:true, \nx:{ \ndomain: [0, 1], \nlabel: \"X\", \n}, \ny: { \ndomain: [0, 3], \nlabel: \"Y\", \n}, \nmarks: [ \nPlot.dot(filtered, {x: \"x\", y: \"y\", fill: \"#444444\", r: 3}), \nPlot.line(true_curve, {x: \"x\", y: \"y\", stroke: \"#B0E1FA\", strokeWidth: 5}), \nPlot.link(errors, { \nx1: \"x\", \nx2: \"x\", \ny1: \"y\", \ny2: \"y_end\", \nstroke: \"#AAAAAA\", \nstrokeDasharray: \"5,5\", \n}) \n]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The different elements of the model. The points represent the observed data \\((X_i, Y_i)\\). The blue curve represents the function \\(f\\) and the dotted lines represent the error associated with each observation.\n\n\n\n\nIn the rest of the course, we will examine different methods for estimating the function f from data. However, before examining how to construct a \\(\\widehat{f}\\) estimator of \\(f\\), we will examine the quality of such an estimator: what does it mean to “properly estimate” f? And how can we evaluate the quality of the estimate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample: Simple Linear Regression\n\n\n\nIn this very simple framework, we assume that the function f is of the form: f(x) = a x + b. In this case, estimating the function f is reduced to estimating the coefficients a and b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipNote: Tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability\n\n\n\nDepending on the objective of the study, we generally have to make a choice between the accuracy of our predictions and the interpretability of our model. A simple model, such as linear regression, will be easy to interpret but will poorly capture complex relationships. Conversely, a more flexible model, such as a random forest, will have better predictions but will be more difficult to interpret. The choice therefore depends on the objective of the analysis: understanding or predictive performance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipNote: No free lunch in statistics\n\n\n\nWhy not simply use the “ultimate” model, the one that would always be optimal regardless of the dataset? Because such a model doesn’t exist! There is no universally best method for all datasets and all objectives. A method that performs well in a given context may fail elsewhere. It is therefore always necessary to adapt the approach to the problem (explanation, prediction, classification, etc.).",

La Figure 2 (b) montre la valeur du biais, de la variance et de la MSE pour les modèles estimés pour la Figure 2 (a). On remarque que plus \\(\\lambda\\) est petit, plus la variance est grande, mais le biais est petit (le modèle est flexible). Inversement, plus \\(\\lambda\\) est grand, plus le biais est grand et la variance petite (le modèle est rigide). La courbe de MSE en fonction du paramètre est une courbe en U. Comme on cherche à minimiser la MSE, i.e. à faire un compromis entre le biais et la variance, on peut prendre \\(\\lambda = 0.5\\).\n\n\nCode\n# Load packages\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nset.seed(42)\n\n# 1.

The \\(\\lambda\\) parameter controls the flexibility of the model; the smaller \\(\\lambda\\), the more flexible the model.\n\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, as flexibility increases, the decrease in bias is greater than the increase in variance, resulting in a decrease in prediction error. However, beyond a certain level of flexibility, the bias becomes negligible, and any further decrease is offset by the rapid increase in variance. Prediction error therefore begins to increase. This results in a U-shaped curve of prediction error as a function of model flexibility: a model that is too rigid generates a high bias, while a model that is too flexible leads to too much variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipNote: Why compromise?\n\n\n\nIt is always possible to build a very flexible model with zero bias, e.g., a model that passes through all observation points, but which will have enormous variance. Conversely, a model that is too rigid, e.g., a constant, will have a very large bias but almost zero variance. The bias/variance compromise consists of choosing a model that controls both of these quantities.",

Thus, the greater the similarity, the closer the observations are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningSimilarity Measure Definition\n\n\n\nA function \\(s: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is a similarity measure on a set \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) if, for all \\(x, y \\in \\mathcal{X}\\), the following conditions hold:\n\n\\(s(x, y) \\geq 0\\);\n\\(s(x, y) = s(y, x)\\);\n\\(s(x, x) = 1 \\geq s(x, y)\\).\n\n\n\nA distance can be transformed into a similarity by setting \\[s(x, y) = \\frac{1}{1 + d(x, y)}.\\]\nThis transformation ensures that the greater the distance, the lower the similarity. However, the reverse is not always possible because a similarity measure does not necessarily respect the triangle inequality. We can also define the dissimilarity between two objects: \\[d^\\star(x, y) = 1 - s(x, y).\\]",

    "section": "Case of qualitative variables",
    "text": "Case of qualitative variables\nWhen working with qualitative variables, the usual numerical distances (such as \\(L_p\\) distances) are generally meaningless. For example, if a variable takes its values ​​from the set \\[\\mathcal{X} = \\{ \\text{Red}, \\text{Green}, \\text{Blue} \\},\\] then it makes no sense to calculate the difference between \\(\\text{Blue}\\) and \\(\\text{Red}\\), because these categories carry no intrinsic numerical structure and have no notion of order or distance.\nBad practice would be to arbitrarily assign numerical values ​​to the variables (e.g., \\(\\text{Red} = 1\\), \\(\\text{Green} = 2\\), \\(\\text{Blue} = 3\\)), which would introduce an artificial order between them. This could significantly bias the analyses.\n\nOne-of-K Encoding\nWhen we want to use a model based on a notion of distance between observations (i.e., most models), we must use a suitable encoding. One-of-K encoding (one-hot encoding) consists of encoding a categorical variable with \\(K\\) categories as a binary vector of dimension \\(K\\), in which only one entry is \\(1\\), the others are \\(0\\). Thus, for the example of \\(\\mathcal{X} = \\{ \\text{Red, Green, Blue} \\}\\), we will obtain the following encoding: “Red” gives \\((1, 0, 0)\\), “Green” gives \\((0, 1, 0)\\), and “Blue” gives \\((0, 0, 1)\\).\nThis encoding method has the advantage of not introducing an artificial order between the modalities. However, if the variable has many modalities, the representation space will be large, which can hinder the effectiveness of some analysis methods.\n\n\nDefine an appropriate distance\nOnce the modalities have been encoded, we can define a distance between two observations of qualitative variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDiscrete Distance (or Hamming Distance)\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) be a discrete set and let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two observations of \\(X\\). The discrete distance is given by \\[d(x, y) = \\begin{cases}\n0, & \\text{if } x = y,\\\\\n1, & \\text{if } x \\neq y\n\\end{cases}.\\]\n\n\nFor vectors of qualitative variables (e.g., the comparison of several individuals described by several characteristics), the discrete distance is the sum of disagreements between the components: \\[d(x, y) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{p} \\mathbb{1}(x_i \\neq y_i),\\] where \\(p\\) is the number of variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nConsider the characteristics of three people.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Characteristics of three people.\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nColor\nEyes\nHair\n\n\n\n\nAlice\nRed\nBlue\nBlonde\n\n\nBob\nGreen\nBlue\nRed\n\n\nChris\nRed\nGreen\nBlonde\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distance between two people is calculated as the number of different characteristics. Thus,\n\\[d(\\text{Alice}, \\text{Bob}) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2,\\]\n\\[d(\\text{Alice}, \\text{Chris}) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1,\\]\n\\[d(\\text{Bob}, \\text{Chris}) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\\]\n\n\nRather than counting the differences, we can also count the agreements and normalize them:\n\\[s(x, y) = \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i = 1}^{p} \\mathbb{1}(x_i = y_i),\\]\nwhich gives a similarity measure between \\(0\\) (no agreement) and \\(1\\) (identical).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nContinuing the previous example (see Table 1), we find the following similarities:\n\\[s(\\text{Alice}, \\text{Bob}) = \\frac{0 + 1 + 0}{3} = \\frac{1}{3},\\]\n\\[s(\\text{Alice}, \\text{Chris}) = \\frac{1 + 0 + 1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3},\\]\n\\[s(\\text{Bob}, \\text{Chris}) = \\frac{0 + 0 + 0}{3} = 0.\\]\n\n\n\n\nJaccard Distance\nWhen the number of binary variables is large (e.g., in the case where a 1 out of K encoding has been performed on p qualitative variables), the discrete distance is not necessarily very suitable because the number of agreements is likely to be small compared to the total number of variables ($K × p in the previous example), which will result in small distances in all cases. One solution is to focus only on attributes that equal 1, because generally, a binary variable equal to 0 does not provide any particular information (at least, less than a binary variable equal to 1). The Jaccard index (Intersection over Union, IoU) was introduced to take this into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningDefinition: Jaccard Index\n\n\n\nConsider two observations x and y of K binary variables. All variables can take the values ​​\\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\nLet’s define the following quantities:\n\n\\(M_{11}\\), the number of \\(1\\) variables for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\);\n\\(M_{10}\\), the number of \\(1\\) variables for \\(x\\) and \\(0\\) for \\(y\\);\n\\(M_{01}\\), the number of \\(0\\) variables for \\(x\\) and \\(1\\) for \\(y\\);\n\\(M_{00}\\), the number of \\(0\\) variables for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nSince each binary variable is necessarily counted in either \\(M_{11}\\), \\(M_{10}\\), \\(M_{01}\\), or \\(M_{00}\\), their sum is therefore equal to \\(K\\).\nThe Jaccard index is defined as \\[J(x, y) = \\frac{M_{11}}{M_{10} + M_{01} + M_{11}} = \\frac{M_{11}}{K - M_{00}}.\\]\n\n\nPaying attention to the case where the two observations consist only of \\(0\\) (we take \\(J(x, y) = 1\\) in this case), the Jaccard index is a measure of similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantProperty: Jaccard Distance\n\n\n\nFor two observations \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) of \\(K\\) binary variables, the Jaccard distance is given by \\[d(x, y) = 1 - J(x, y).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteProof\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show that the Jaccard distance is indeed a distance, we must demonstrate the four properties of distances. First, note that the Jaccard distance can be rewritten as \\[d(x, y) = \\frac{M_{10} + M_{01}}{M_{01} + M_{10} + M_{11}}.\\]\n\nAll terms in the numerator and denominator are positive, so \\(d(x, y) \\geq 0\\).\nLet us show that \\(d(x, y) = 0 \\Leftrightarrow x = y\\).\n\nSuppose that \\(d(x, y) = 0\\). Then \\(M_{01} + M_{10} = 0\\). Therefore, there are no variables that equal \\(0\\) for \\(x\\) and \\(1\\) for \\(y\\), and vice versa. Since \\(M_{01} + M_{10} + M_{11} &gt; 0\\), we have \\(x = y\\).\nNow, suppose that \\(x = y\\). Then \\(M_{01} = M_{10} = 0\\). Therefore \\(d(x, y) = 0\\).\n\nWe have that \\(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\\) because the Jaccard index is symmetric.\nThe proof of the triangle inequality will be done in an exercise (see TD)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nConsider a questionnaire with 5 closed questions. Suppose the answer “Yes” is coded as 1 and the answer “No” is coded as 0.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Characteristics of two people.\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ5\n\n\n\n\nAlice\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nBob\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the distance between Alice and Bob, we have \\(M_{11} = 1\\), \\(M_{10} = 1\\), \\(M_{01} = 1\\), and \\(M_{00} = 2\\). Therefore, the Jaccard similarity is given by \\(J(\\text{Alice}, \\text{Bob}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\). Thus, the Jaccard distance is \\(d(\\text{Alice}, \\text{Bob}) = 1 - J(x, y) = \\frac{2}{3}\\).",

    "section": "Evaluating the Performance of a Predictive Model",
    "text": "Evaluating the Performance of a Predictive Model\nIn the previous section, we introduced tools for measuring the quality of an estimator: the mean square error (MSE) for quantitative variables and the error rate (ER) for qualitative variables. These measures compare the predicted values ​​\\(\\widehat{Y} = \\widehat{f}(X)\\) to the observed values ​​\\(Y\\). However, if we calculate these errors only from the data used to train the model, we risk underestimating the true prediction error. Why? Because the estimator \\(\\widehat{f}\\) was adjusted to minimize the error on these same data. It therefore fits them well, and generally, too well! This can lead to the illusion that our model is performing well. Indeed, a very flexible model can have a low error on the training data simply because it captures noise rather than signal. But if the model adapts too much to the training data, it risks generalizing poorly to new data, i.e., data it has never seen before. This phenomenon is called overfitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipNote: Overfitting and Underfitting\n\n\n\nAn overly flexible model can fit the training data perfectly, including random noise. It will have a low error on this data but a high error on new observations. This is called overfitting of the model. Conversely, a model that is too rigid (e.g., a constant straight line) will not be able to capture the structure of the data, even on the training set. This is called underfitting of the model.\nThe goal is to find the right balance between flexibility and generalization capacity.\n\n\nTo objectively evaluate a model, ideally, it would be best to test it on data completely independent of the data used for training. We therefore distinguish two sets: a training set, used to adjust the model, and a test set, used to evaluate the model’s predictive performance. In practice, we generally don’t have access to a test set to perform this evaluation. In this section, we will discuss two approaches to circumvent this problem.",

The right choice depends on the context, the complexity of the model, and the amount of data available.\n\n\nHowever, this method has two drawbacks. The first is that the error estimate is unstable. Indeed, the value of the prediction error depends on the observations in the validation set. A different validation set may give a different result. The second is that there is less data to fit the model. Since part of the data is reserved for validation, the model is trained on a smaller set, and this may therefore overestimate its true error compared to if it had been trained on the full dataset.",

    "text": "Cross-validation\nTo overcome the limitations of the previous approach, cross-validation is often used. This method is more robust and stable. The principle is to repeat the validation set approach several times on different subsets of the dataset.\nThe approach consists of randomly dividing the set of observations into K subsets of equal size (called folds). The first fold is used as the validation dataset and the model is fitted on the remaining K - 1 folds. The prediction error is calculated on the first fold. This procedure is repeated K times; each time, a different fold is used as the validation dataset. At the end, we have \\(K\\) values ​​for the prediction error. Finally, we calculate the average of the \\(K\\) prediction values. Figure 3 presents a diagram of this approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Diagram of the cross-validation approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow to choose the number of subsets \\(K\\)?\n\n\n\nThe choice of the number of subsets \\(K\\) has an impact on the quality of the prediction error estimation, as well as on the computational cost of the procedure. In practice, \\(K = 5\\) or \\(K = 10\\) are often used. This choice is based on a compromise between the accuracy of the error estimation and the required computational time. Indeed, for each value of \\(K\\), the model is fitted \\(K\\) times. Therefore, the larger \\(K\\) is, the greater the computational cost.\nIn the limiting case where \\(K = n\\), i.e. \\(K\\) is equal to the number of observations in the dataset, this is called leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). In this case, each observation is used as validation once, and the model is trained on the other \\(n - 1\\) observations.\nThis choice of \\(K = n\\) minimizes bias in the prediction error estimate, because at each iteration, the model is fitted to almost all the observations in the dataset. However, this comes at the cost of high variance. Indeed, since the training sets are almost identical, the prediction errors are highly correlated, making the overall error estimate unstable.\nConversely, lower values ​​of \\(K\\) introduce a slight bias in the error estimate (because the models are fitted to sets containing fewer observations), but reduce the variance of this estimate. This bias/variance tradeoff, coupled with a significant reduction in computation time, explains why \\(K = 5\\) or \\(K = 10\\) are standard choices in practice.\n\n\nFinally, cross-validation is a general method that can be applied to most models.",

    "text": "Row profiles and column profiles\nTo analyze the structures in the contingency table, we introduce the concept of a profile. Each row of the table can be viewed as a row profile \\[L_i = \\left( \\frac{k_{i 1}}{k_{i \\bullet}}, \\dots, \\frac{k_{i p}}{k_{i \\bullet}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{f_{i 1}}{f_{i \\bullet}}, \\dots, \\frac{f_{i p}}{f_{i \\bullet}} \\right).\\] The line profile represents the distribution of the modalities \\(i\\) of the first variable among the modalities of the second.\nSimilarly, each column of the table can be viewed as a column profile \\[C_j = \\left( \\frac{k_{1 j}}{k_{\\bullet j}}, \\dots, \\frac{k_{n j}}{k_{\\bullet j}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{f_{1 j}}{f_{\\bullet j}}, \\dots, \\frac{f_{n j}}{f_{\\bullet j}} \\right)\n.\\] The column profile represents the distribution of the modalities \\(j\\) of the second variable among the modalities of the first.\nWe can then look at the mean row profile (resp. mean column profile) obtained as the weighted average of the row profiles (resp. column profiles). In other words, they correspond to the marginal frequencies of the columns (resp. marginal frequencies of the rows). The mean row profile is given by \\[\\left( \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f_{i \\bullet} \\frac{f_{i 1}}{f_{i \\bullet}}, \\dots, \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f_{i \\bullet} \\frac{f_{i p}}{f_{i \\bullet}} \\right) = \\left( f_{\\bullet 1}, \\dots, f_{\\bullet p} \\right),\\] and the average column profile is given by \\[\\left( \\sum_{j = 1}^{p} f_{{\\bullet j}} \\frac{f_{1 j}}{f_{\\bullet j}}, \\dots, \\sum_{j = 1}^{p} f_{\\bullet j} \\frac{f_{n j}}{f_{\\bullet j}} \\right) = \\left( f_{{1 \\bullet}}, \\dots, f_{n \\bullet} \\right).\\]\nIf the variables are independent, all profiles are equal to their respective average profiles. In other words, for all \\(i \\in \\{ 1, \\dots, n \\}\\) and \\(j \\in \\{ 1, \\dots, p \\}\\), \\[\\left( \\frac{f_{i 1}}{f_{i ⊗}}, \\dots, \\frac{f_{i p}}{f_{i ⊗}} \\right) = \\left( f_{\\bullet 1}, \\dots, f_{\\bullet p} \\right) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n\\left( \\frac{f_{1 j}}{f_{\\bullet j}}, \\dots, \\frac{f_{n j}}{f_{\\bullet j}} \\right) = \\left( f_{{1 \\bullet}}, \\dots, f_{n \\bullet} \\right).\\] Thus, the further the profiles deviate from their means, the more the variables show dependence.\nTo measure the difference between two line profiles, we use the \\(\\chi^2\\) distance weighted by marginal frequencies: \\[d^2(L_i, L_{i^\\prime}) = \\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \\frac{1}{f_{\\bullet j}} \\left( \\frac{f_{ij}}{f_{i \\bullet}} - \\frac{f_{i^\\prime j}}{f_{i^\\prime \\bullet}} \\right)^2.\\] We can do the same for the difference between two column profiles: \\[d^2(C_j, C_{j^\\prime}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\frac{1}{f_{i \\bullet}} \\left( \\frac{f_{ij}}{f_{\\bullet j}} - \\frac{f_{i j^\\prime}}{f_{\\bullet j^\\prime}} \\right)^2.\\]\nThis can be written in matrix form. Let \\(D_n = \\text{diag}(f_{i \\bullet})\\) be the diagonal matrix of row weights and \\(D_p = \\text{diag}(f_{\\bullet j})\\) be the diagonal matrix of column weights. The matrix \\(D_n^{-1}F\\) has the row profiles as its rows, and the matrix \\(D_p^{-1}F^{\\top}\\) has the column profiles as its rows. The \\(\\chi^2\\) distance between two row profiles \\(L_i\\) and \\(L_{i^\\prime}\\) is then written as \\[d^2(L_i, L_{i^\\prime}) = (L_i - L_{i^\\prime})^\\top D_p^{-1} (L_i - L_{i^\\prime}),\\] and similarly for two column profiles \\(C_j\\) and \\(C_{j^\\prime}\\) \\[d^2(C_j, C_{j^\\prime}) = (C_j - C_{j^\\prime})^\\top D_n^{-1} (C_j - C_{j^\\prime}).\\]\nThese distances form the basis of geometric representation in correspondence analysis, where we seek a projection of the profiles into a low-dimensional space that best preserves these distances.",

Since \\(\\lambda_1\\) is the largest eigenvalue of \\(F^{\\top} D_n^{-1} F D_p^{-1}\\), we can deduce that \\(\\mu_1 \\leq \\lambda_{1}\\).

We can also deduce the relationships between the eigenvalues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipNote\n\n\n\nBy centering the profiles, we can project the line profiles and column profiles onto the same coordinate system, thus facilitating joint geometric interpretation.\n\n\nCenter of gravity and inertia\nIn statistical software outputs, the scatter plot generated by an AFC is generally centered at (0, 0). This convention reflects an analysis relative to the centers of gravity of the line profiles and column profiles. This centering is both practical and interpretable. It shows the distances between the modalities relative to their weighted mean, i.e., relative to the average behavior in the population.\nEach modality (row or column) is associated with a weight corresponding to its marginal frequency: the weight of the \\(i\\)th row is \\(f_{i \\bullet}\\) and the weight of the \\(j\\)th column is \\(f_{\\bullet j}\\). The center of gravity of the rows is the weighted average of the row profiles:\n\\[G_L = \\left( g_{1}, \\dots, g_{p} \\right)^{\\top}, \\quad \\text{where}\\quad g_j = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f_{i \\bullet} \\frac{f_{i j}}{f_{i \\bullet}} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f_{i j} = f_{\\bullet j}, j \\in \\{ 1, \\dots, p \\}.\\]\nSimilarly, the center of gravity of the columns is \\[G_C = \\left( f_{1 \\bullet}, \\dots, f_{n \\bullet} \\right)^{\\top}.\\]\nTo re-center the profiles around the center of gravity, we subtract their mean value: \\[\\frac{f_{i j}}{f_{i \\bullet}} - g_{j} = \\frac{f_{i j}}{f_{i \\bullet}} - f_{\\bullet j} = \\frac{f_{i j} - f_{i \\bullet} f_{\\bullet j}}{f_{i \\bullet}}.\\] This centering ensures that each line profile \\(i \\in \\{ 1, \\dots, n \\}\\) is averaged to zero: \\[\\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \\frac{f_{i j} - f_{i \\bullet}f_{\\bullet j}}{f_{i \\bullet}} = 0.\\]\nAFC is therefore no longer performed on matrix \\(S\\) but rather on a centered matrix \\(S^\\star = (s_{j j^\\prime}^\\star),\\) where \\[s_{j j^\\prime}^\\star = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\frac{\\left( f_{i j} - f_{i \\bullet} f_{\\bullet j} \\right) \\left( f_{i j^\\prime} - f_{i \\bullet} f_{\\bullet j^\\prime} \\right)}{f_{i \\bullet} f_{\\bullet j^\\prime}}.\\]\nBy definition, the trace of the matrix \\(S^\\star\\) gives the total inertia: \\[\\text{tr}(S^\\star) = \\sum_{j = 1}^{p} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\frac{\\left( f_{i j} - f_{i \\bullet}f_{\\bullet j} \\right)^2}{f_{i \\bullet} f_{\\bullet j}}.\\] This corresponds to the normalized \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic used to test the independence between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantProperty\n\n\n\nWe have that, for all \\(j, j^\\prime \\in \\{ 1, \\dots, p \\}\\), \\(s_{j j^\\prime}^\\star = s_{j j^\\prime} - f_{\\bullet j},\\) where \\[s_{j j^\\prime} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\frac{f_{i j}f_{i j^\\prime}}{f_{i \\bullet} f_{\\bullet j^\\prime}}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipProof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous property implies that the matrices \\(S\\) and \\(S^\\star\\) have the same eigenvectors for the first \\(p\\) dimensions, which allows us to perform factorial analysis on the centered version.",
